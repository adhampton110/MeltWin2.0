# Docker Image is built in `deploy-shiny.yaml` file in the `.github/workflows` folder.

# This Dockerfile is used to build the Docker image for the MeltShiny app.

# Use the Rocker Docker image with R 4.2.1 and Shiny Server pre-installed - this works best if you are not using an Apple Sillicon chip.

# MeltR is not on CRAN, so it needs to be installed from GitHub
